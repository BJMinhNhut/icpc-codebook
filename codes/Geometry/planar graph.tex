\textbf{Euler theorem.} any correct embedding of a connected planar graph with $n$ vertices, $m$ edges and $f$ faces satisfies:
$$
n - m + f = 2
$$
And more generally, every planar graph with $k$ connected components satisfies:
$$
n-m+f = 1+k
$$

If $n \ge 3$ then the \textbf{maximum number of edges} of a planar graph with $n$ vertices is
$3n - 6$. 
This number is achieved by any connected planar graph where each face is bounded by \textit{a triangle}. 

If $n \ge 3$ then the \textbf{maximum number of faces} of a planar graph with 
$n$ vertices is $2n - 4$.

\textbf{Minimum vertex degree in a planar graph.}
Every planar graph has \textbf{a vertex} of degree 5 or less.
